**Team members** that worked on this project: [Ioan Ionescu](https://github.com/Ionescu-Ioan) and me.

This homework project consists of:  
- recreating the basic musical notes (from an octave of choice, in our case the 4th)  
- play a song of choice in a single signal (our choice was Wiegenlied- Brahms' Lullaby)
- read a music score using LilyPond or a custom format in order to play a specific song (composing tones associated with notes automatically): we created a custom format 
that helps us read notes from a [.txt file](./musicScore.txt) and translate them into tones
